# Development Guide

## Contributions to the library

We happily welcome your contributions. Following is the general process we follow for contributions

* If you have an idea for a contribution, start with a Github issue to discuss your proposal. Once you receive
feedback on your proposal, move onto the coding stage
* Create a git fork of the repository and make your changes in your personal fork
* Make sure the test coverage for your change is 80+% before you are ready
* Run `make` and verify linter / tests pass without errors
* Create a pull request against the master repo
* All changes go through a code review and you must also sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/uber-go/kafka-client)
